# FIWB: Institutional Intelligence & Digital Twin

FIWB is a state-of-the-art **Neural Academic Assistant** designed to act as a student's **Digital Twin**. It bridges the gap between institutional course materials (Classroom, Moodle) and personal workspace context (Gmail, Drive), providing an elite Socratic mentoring experience.

## 🧠 Core Intelligence Pillars

### 1. The Digital Twin (Long-Term Memory)
- **Neural Synthesis**: Every interaction is analyzed to extract strengths, knowledge gaps, and communication preferences.
- **Perpetual Context**: The AI "grows" with you, remembering past discussions and evolving its teaching style.
- **Memory Bank**: Synthesized insights are stored in a dedicated high-fidelity memory vault for long-term recall.

### 2. Neural Assistant (Personal Workspace)
- **Gmail Primary Inbox Sync**: Proactively monitors your inbox to extract assignments, appointments, and personal context.
- **Google Drive Integration**: Indexes PDFs, documents, and notes directly into your cognitive workspace.
- **Task & Deadline Awareness**: Automatically identifies commitments from emails and references them naturally during tutoring.

### 3. Socratic Institutional Mentor
- **Institutional Sync**: Deep integration with **Google Classroom** and **Moodle**.
- **Evidence-Based Mentoring**: Quotes directly from your course materials and academic notes.
- **Socratic Method**: Instead of just giving answers, the AI guides students through complex concepts using inquiry-based learning.

## 🚀 High-Performance Architecture

- **Parallel Brain Execution**: Simultaneous query classification and multi-stream knowledge retrieval for ultra-low latency.
- **Unified Knowledge Graph (Supermemory)**: A single vector-space for all context—academic notes, emails, chat uploads, and memories.
- **Vibrant UI/UX**:
    - **LaTeX Support**: High-fidelity math rendering for STEM subjects.
    - **Glassmorphic Design**: Modern, responsive interface with fluid micro-animations.
    - **Multi-Modal**: Native support for PDF analysis and image-based reasoning.

## 💰 Intelligence Cost Analyzer (Industrial Grade)

FIWB features a tiered financial tracking system for transparent resource management:
- **SLM Tier**: Low-cost background tasks (Triage, Memory Synthesis, Query Rewriting).
- **LLM Tier**: High-premium intelligence for Socratic mentoring and deep reasoning.
- **Supermemory Tier**: Token-based tracking for vector indexing and storage overhead.
- **Real-Time Billing**: Estimated USD costs are calculated per-user and logged with micro-precision.
